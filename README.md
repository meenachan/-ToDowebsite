 ToDo website
 
 Viewing the website as a guest/anyone but admin is an issue, because the code cannot find the HTML/CSS files. 

However, viewing http://127.0.0.1:8100/admin will take you to a login page. Logging in will allow a user to see their current dashboard.
This dashboard is remembered even when the user logs out and comes back in. I accidentally made a database and have no idea how.

username: todoApp
email address (optional): testEmail@todoApp.com
password: eeeeeeee
Notice the password is the letter "e", 8 times.

This is the tutorial used:
