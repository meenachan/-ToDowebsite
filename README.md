 ToDo website
 
This should be a fully "functional" website, with stylized CSS. Both viewing as a guest and as an admin should work. 

Adding should be no problem, and pressing "delete" when nothing selected should be no problem either.
However, users can only delete one item at a time. Selecting multiple will only delete one.

To log in as an admin:
username: testUser
email address (optional): testUser@toDo.com
password: eeeeeeee
Notice the password is the letter "e", 8 times.

This is the tutorial used:
