 ToDo website
 
The home page, login page, and main pages should all be connected now.
Notice that you don't actually get verified with your username and password when you log in: you can just push "go" and you'll go in anyway.
Deletion is still partially buggy: deleting multiple tasks at the same time does not work, and will only delete the first one you selected.

To log in as an admin,
username: todoApp
email address (optional): testEmail@todoApp.com
password: eeeeeeee
Notice the password is the letter "e", 8 times.

This is the tutorial used:
